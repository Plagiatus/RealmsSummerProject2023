# RealmsSummerProject2023

A Project including a bunch of developers from the realms mapmaking community, collaborating on a big minigame mashup.

## If you're a contributor

...here are some resources for you:

- [How to set up your work environment](https://github.com/Plagiatus/MapmakingTemplate)
- [The google drive that we keep our documents in](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1goiQoCT-sWcP90RlbPURQIHVLfXvQO1t)


Remember to coordinate a little bit on your games, so you don't overlap namespaces or CustomModelData etc. More info on the discord.
